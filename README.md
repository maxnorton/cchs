Tracking work with the Canadian Community Health Survey PUMF.

Focus is on data vintage 2009 and later. The 2008-2009 cycle is not currently included because it only samples Canadians 45 and older.

### Errata

Due to a data error described in the 2015-2016 data dictionary (page 35) in combination with limitations on public data availability, I have marked respondent's highest level of education as missing for every 2015-2016 observation.

### Branches
employment-proxy: A modification of the original data import scripts that builds a proxy for employment status out of publicly available data. Abandoned, as the proxy is not very credible.
